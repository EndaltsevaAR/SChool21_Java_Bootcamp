Java Basics Project
This project covers the basics of solving both trivial and more challenging business tasks using basic Java language constructs. It includes six exercises aimed at enhancing your understanding of Java programming.

Description
The project encompasses six exercises, each designed to tackle different aspects of Java programming while addressing real-world business scenarios.

Exercise 00 – Sum of Digits: Implementing logic to calculate the sum of digits in a given number.

Exercise 01 – Really Prime Number: Exploring prime numbers and implementing algorithms to determine whether a number is prime.

Exercise 02 – Endless Sequence (or not?): Investigating sequences in Java and determining whether a sequence is endless or finite.

Exercise 03 – A Little Bit of Statistics: Applying basic statistical operations to a dataset.

Exercise 04 – A Bit More of Statistics: Extending statistical operations to handle larger datasets.

Exercise 05 – Schedule: Managing schedules using Java, including sorting, filtering, and organizing events.

Stack
The project utilizes the following stack:
- Standard operations of primitive types
- Conditions
- Loops
- Streams
- Collections
- IO
- Time/Date

Usage
To use this project, clone the repository and navigate to each exercise directory. Each exercise contains a separate Java file with instructions commented within the code. Follow the instructions provided and run the Java files to see the output.

Getting Started
Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download it from Oracle's website.
