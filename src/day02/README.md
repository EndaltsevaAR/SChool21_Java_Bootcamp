Day 02 - IO and Files


Here, you will learn how to utilize input/output in Java and implement programs to manipulate a file system. This repository consists of three exercises:


Exercise 00 – File Signatures
In this exercise, you will explore how to identify file types using file signatures. File signatures, also known as magic numbers or file headers, are unique byte sequences at the beginning of files that can help determine their types. You will learn how to read these signatures and perform file type detection programmatically.

Exercise 01 – Words
Exercise 01 focuses on working with text files and manipulating words within them. You will develop programs to count words, search for specific words or phrases, and perform other word-related tasks. This exercise will enhance your understanding of file input/output operations and string manipulation in Java.

Exercise 02 – File Manager
In Exercise 02, you will implement a file manager application. This application will provide functionalities such as creating, deleting, copying, and moving files and directories. You will learn how to interact with the file system using Java's IO API and manage files and directories programmatically.
